Hi, Iâ€™m @IL0MA

-Strong: I enjoy doing documentation and explaining the parts and summarizing their uses. The organization part of it has always got my attention so yea I always do it when I was coded in Python and Visual Basics 

-Weak: I have no idea how to code. I have little experience with Visual Basics and Python but nothing really serious.

-Expect to Learn: I expect to learn how to code a bit with Java and how to collaborate in a team effort of a pograming team and how that functions. 

-Concerns: I dont know of what use I would be to this team with no skill sin coding since I don't know how to use Java and never have used it.
